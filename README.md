# Math-IO![logo_color.png](static%2Flogo_color.png)
MathIO is an interactive Fast-API platform that connects mathematics with artificial intelligence.  
It provides a simple web interface and API for performing operations on data, matrices, and images —  
powered by algorithms and models implemented in the **AImagination** project.

## Purpose
- Serve as a practical interface to AI and mathematical methods  
- Demonstrate how mathematical operations power modern AI models  
- Visualize computations and results in an accessible way  
- Integrate directly with reusable algorithms from AImagination
